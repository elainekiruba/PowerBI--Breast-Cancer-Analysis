## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

To develop an interactive **Power BI dashboard** that visually presents insights from breast cancer data, including diagnosis distributions, key performance indicators (KPIs), and comparative feature analysis. This will help healthcare professionals:

- Track the count of malignant and benign cases
- Observe correlations between medical features (e.g., radius, texture, symmetry)
- Gain faster and data-driven insights

## ðŸ§  Proposed Solution

The project uses Power BI to:

- Import and clean breast cancer data
- Convert the **diagnosis column** into a categorical format (Benign or Malignant)
- Create **KPI Cards** for:
  - Total Patients
  - Total Malignant Cases
  - Total Benign Cases
- Develop visualizations like
